Thoughts on writing user stories

Basic story answers the questions: Who, what, why?
As a <who> I want <what> so that <why>?

Alternative: In order to <achieve the vision> as a <stakeholder> I want <something>

Why you want to INVEST in stories:
Independent?
- Easier to sashimi
- Avoids problems with prioritization
- Avoid volatile dependencies
- Explicit dependencies are OK

Negotiable?
- Avoid bundling - eg: VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray and HD DVD

Valuable?
- If it's not valuable, then don't do it.
- Why waste time on features that aren't valuable to most users?
- Try to front-load value during the planning
- "Waste is anything that does not add value" mary & tom poppendieck


Estimable?
- Well, you want to know when you're going to be done
- If you can't tell how long it will take, then maybe the story's not complete, or it's missing other info.

Sized?
- Also want to make stories the right size for completing in a sprint (iteration)
- Avoid absolute sizing - that's tough.
- Go for relative sizing - that's easier

Testable?
"Writing a story card carries an implicit promise: " I understand what I want well enough that I could write a test for it." William C Wake
Write acceptance criteria along with the story
Documentation could be a simple bulleted list.

Stories vs Tasks
Stories in the product backlog
Tasks in the iteration backlog

Stories identified by anyone, owned by the PO
Tasks are Identified by the delivery team, Owned by the individual

Stories are Completed in an iteration
Tasks are Completed in an iteration

Stories Estimated in story points
Varying levels of granularity
Tasks Estimated in ideal hours Usually 2-16

Warning: beware of partial stories!
